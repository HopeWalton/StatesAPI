# U.S. States API â€“ INF653 Final Project

This project is a RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB** that provides detailed information about U.S. states, including their capital, nickname, population, admission date, and fun facts. Static data is merged with dynamic content stored in MongoDB Atlas. The app is deployed using **Glitch** and supports automated testing through **Netlify**.
